## My process

- in mind that I should start with mobile-first way. I opened design for mobile and started to write necessary code.
- started with html that was needed in first look.
- then started to write css.
- while progressing some more html (div for text) was found necessary/needed at time.
- add new css for new html
- after getting it working for mobile openew desktop design
- added @media for desktop design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- first thing after completing challenge I noticed that @media query was kinda overkill -> this was caused by not looking at both designs first. -> LOOK AT ALL DESIGN FIRST (and compare them) .
